# üí∏ Credit Score classification

A machine learning-based web app that predicts a user's financial risk score based on various banking and income-related parameters.

## üöÄ Features

- Predicts based on user attributes such as income, credit history, and debt.
- Uses **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for prediction.
- Applied **Data Preprocessing**, **Feature Engineering**, and **EDA** to refine model performance.
- Designed for **static datasets** (no live training).
